# Python Generators
This project introduces me to advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s yield keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I will:

* <b>Master Python Generators</b>: Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
* <b>Handle Large Datasets</b>: Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
* <b>Simulate Real-world Scenarios</b>: Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
* <b>Optimize Performance</b>: Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
* <b>Apply SQL Knowledge</b>: Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.
