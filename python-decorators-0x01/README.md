# Python Decorators

## Project Description

This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications. Through hands-on tasks, I will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections, manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results. The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, providing me with an in-depth understanding of Pythonâ€™s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, I will:

* <b>Deepen my knowledge of Python decorators</b> and how they can be used to create reusable, efficient, and clean code.
* <b>Enhance database management skills</b> by automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.
* <b>Implement robust transaction management techniques</b> to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.
* <b>Optimize database queries<b> by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.
* <b>Build resilience into database operations</b> by implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
* <b>Apply best practices in database interaction</b> for scalable and maintainable Python applications.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher installed.
* SQLite3 database setup with a users table for testing.
* A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.
* Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.
* Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

## Key Highlights

#### Task 0: Logging Database Queries

* Create a decorator to log all SQL queries executed by a function.
* Learn to intercept function calls to enhance observability.

#### Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator

* Automate database connection handling with a decorator.
* Eliminate boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.

#### Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator

* Implement a decorator to manage database transactions (commit/rollback).
* Ensure robust error handling and data consistency.

#### Task 3: Retry Database Queries

* Build a decorator to retry database operations on failure.
* Introduce resilience against transient database issues.

#### Task 4: Cache Database Queries

* Implement a decorator to cache query results.
* Optimize performance by avoiding redundant database calls.
